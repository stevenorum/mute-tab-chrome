# <img src="src/imgs/128.png" width="30"> Chrome Tab Automute



Automatically mutes new tabs, so that autoplaying videos and sound effects don't interrupt with your music/Netflix/whatever.

## Install

1. Enable the "Tab audio muting UI control" in
chrome://flags/. Extension uses this
experimental feature (as of Chrome 51). Quick access at
[chrome://flags/#enable-tab-audio-muting](chrome://flags/#enable-tab-audio-muting)

2. Install this extension.  Currently must be done from source as I haven't bothered to put it up in the Chrome extension store yet.

The instructions in this README and the icons/screenshots are from [danhp/mute-tab-chrome](https://github.com/danhp/mute-tab-chrome) by [Daniel Pham](https://danhp.github.io) and are under the MIT license.  In addition, the code for that extension, although not reused in this one, made figuring out how to write this one incredibly simple.
